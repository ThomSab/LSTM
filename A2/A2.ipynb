    "\n",
    "In the previous assignment we found that the Jordan network is incapable of memorizing information over longer time spans. Now we want to delve deeper into why this is case and how to solve this problem. To learn long-term dependencies, it is necessary that the gradient carries the error signal backwards in time. For instance, if the output at time $t$ depends on the input at time $s$ with $s < t$, then the Jacobian \n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(t, s) = \\frac{\\partial a(t)}{\\partial a(s)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "is responsible for carrying the error signals from time $t$ backwards to time $s$. Calculate this Jacobian for the Jordan network and elaborate on the numerical stability of $J(t, s)$ for long time spans, i.e., when $t-s$ becomes large. Why is the Jordan network incapable of learning long-term dependencies?"

    "Analyzing full BPTT for LSTM we find that the recurrent connections through the gates causes most of the intricacy of the backward logic, while the simple inner recurrent connections are responsible for carrying the error signals over long time spans. The *LSTM learning method* truncates the gradient of these outer recurrent connections. In other words, the gates treat $h(t)$ as if they were external inputs and disregard their dependence on the model. This simplifies the gradients and makes RTRL feasible. \n",
